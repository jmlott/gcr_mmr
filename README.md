# gcr_mmr
Grabs Rocket League MMR data for a list of players and adds it to a Google Sheet


gcr_mmr.py is the file that was used for season 5 of the GCR to update the Vytarien spreadsheet.

mmr_update.py is a newer and cleaner version that updates a personal spreadsheet that can be used as a reference.
